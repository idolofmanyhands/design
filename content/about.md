## 1. An early passion


Ever since I first used a 56k modem, I've been fascinated by the idea of an accessible world of information exchange. My journey began with creating rudimentary websites for friends, bands and communities I was part of. 

Those early experiences launched my career, from building portfolio websites with Dreamweaver to exploring Photoshop (I became an **Adobe Certified Expert for Photoshop CS6 (ACE)** in 2012).


## 2. Pragmatism and attention to detail


In 2013, I joined a small agency, **3rdPLACE**, where I did wireframing, interface design using Photoshop and Sketch, and also delved into front-end work, coding and DEM testing. 

It was at this agency that I learnt to be pragmatic and detail-oriented, and the importance of data-driven design.

I was constantly searching for the best and most reliable ways to build websites, documenting my workflow findings, including exploring Gulp.js ([view article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gulp-i-improved-my-workflow-354d31d25655/)).


## 3. Broadening my horizons


In 2016, I became part of **H-Art**, which was later transformed into **AKQA Italy**. This transition marked a pivotal point in my career, as it allowed me to sharpen my focus on the UX space. It also provided a unique opportunity to team up with skilled professionals from different practices, including data, strategy, development and project management.

I made it a priority to openly share my thought processes and foster an environment where everyone involved in a project felt heard and valued. This **collaborative experience** significantly broadened my horizons and added depth to my professional journey.

During my time at **AKQA Italy**, I've been **involved in a wide range of projects**, each presenting unique challenges and valuable learning opportunities. 

These projects have ranged from critical maintenance and digital transformation to in-depth information architecture mapping, competitive analysis, user flows, pitches, workshops and audits. My primary tools have been Slack, Figma, Sketch, Omnigraffle, Miro, Excel and Keynote.


## 4. Web Accessibility


One of my proudest achievements is becoming a **certified professional in web accessibility (CPACC, by IAAP)** in 2018 ([view certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/22151118-de46-409a-9aa3-34892f4e79ef/public_url)). This expertise has been instrumental in shaping the scope of work (SOW), and guiding testing and pitch strategies. I've also streamlined the process of knowledge sharing within the Experience Design practice, setting up internal Slack channels for accessibility topics in the Italian studio and contributing to the global cross-studio channel for inclusivity discussions.
